# Odin-RockPS

### Description

This project is built as an assignment given by The Odin Project. It is a responsive webiste which allows user to play the classic game of "Rock Paper Scissors". This project applies JavaScript logic to interact with the user and advance CSS for better user-experience. It is also responsive so it will function well on most types of devices and screens (except very large ones, in those screens some features might look small).
